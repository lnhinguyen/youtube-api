# Python - Youtube API Analysis

## Overview
  In this project,  I will use Youtube API to do exploratory analysis of my favorite Youtube channel ("Thu Vu Data Analytics") and answer the following questions:

### Part 1: Compare the channel to 4 other channels with the same type of content (Data Analysis/Science)
1) Compare the total subscribers
2) Compare the total videos
3) Compare the total views
4) Is there a relationship between number of videos and number of subscribers/total views?

### Part 2: Analyze the channel:
1) What are the top viewed videos?
2) What are the top liked videos?
3) Is there a relationship between number of views and likes?
4) View distribution of uploaded videos
5) Commonly used words in video titles
  
## Analysis Steps & Skills
- API keys and get credentials

- Visualization (bar charts, violinplot, scatterplot, wordcloud)

Please look at the IPYNB file as I explained carefully my steps and thought process.
